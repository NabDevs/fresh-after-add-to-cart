# fresh-after-add-to-cart

This is a custom WooCommerce plugin I developed for enhancing the user experience after a product is added to the cart. The plugin displays a custom modal with cross-sell product suggestions and action buttons, using WooCommerce product data and AJAX logic.

Key features:

Shows a dynamic modal after adding a product to the cart

Retrieves cross-sell products based on cart contents or manual IDs

Supports variable products and displays selected variation

AJAX-based cart interaction and WooCommerce fragments

Uses Swiper.js for front-end product carousel

Written in PHP (OOP), integrates with native WooCommerce functionality

My role:
I developed this plugin from a starter boilerplate, implemented the custom logic, and extended it with AJAX handlers, modal rendering, and product data retrieval. This project demonstrates my ability to build extendable WooCommerce plugins and handle user interactions programmatically.
